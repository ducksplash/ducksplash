Some stuff I did or am doing, vaguely in order of doing.

  
<h3><a href="https://github.com/ducksplash/WalletSentinel">Wallet Sentinel</a></h3>
<i>A small Web3.js programme to monitor wallets on various ethereum-based blockchains and forward all incoming funds to another address.  This is a proof of concept programme borne out of pure curiosity</i>

Wallet Sentinel will soon be hosted live on the Polygon network!
  
  <a href="http://walletsentinel.dao">WalletSentinel.dao</a> <b>(!)</b>
  
  <b>(!)</b> The address above is a new type of domain known as an <b>"Unstoppable Domain"</b> which can ironically be stopped without the <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension">necessary browser extension</b>.
  Decidedly sub-tremendous; I'll hold off on abandoning traditional HTTP for the mean time ;P

Generic Drops will be a turnkey solution that can be deployed by anyone with a web hosting plan, or LAMP at home.

  <b>(!)</b> This is the in-dev version for the client; eventually these will diverge as the contracted work has ended and the fun begins.
