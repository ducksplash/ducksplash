<b>Some stuff I did or am doing, vaguely in order of doing.</b>

<i>N.B. while some of my work may look gnarley, please try to understand that I am a code guy, not a front end guy, and everything I do, I do on my own; with no team, no budget, and computer equipment so old that God's dad doesn't want it back - he's upgraded to Babbage's Difference Engine, and I have to believe that if I had the same kinda resources as the blue haired teenagers in NIGDN, I'd have bare shipped titles & sales by now :P</i>

Get the marble past the various obstacles and enemies any way you can.

There is only one rule: do not run out of time.

Yes, you can be a duck, or a clover, or something else - in any colour you like.

<h2>‚Çø <a href="https://github.com/ducksplash/WalletSentinel">Wallet Sentinel</a></h2>
<i>A small Web3.js programme to monitor wallets on various ethereum-based blockchains and forward all incoming funds to another address.  This is a proof of concept programme borne out of pure curiosity</i>

Wallet Sentinel is now hosted live on the Polygon-Matic network!
  
  <a href="http://walletsentinel.dao">WalletSentinel.dao</a> <b>(!)</b>
  
  <b>(!)</b> The address above is a new type of domain known as an <b>"Unstoppable Domain"</b> which can ironically be stopped without the <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension">necessary browser extension</a>.
  
  Decidedly sub-tremendous; I'll hold off on abandoning traditional HTTP for the mean time ;P 
  
  If you don't fancy a whole browser extension just to view a one-pager, here's <a href="https://bafybeibcymhvludsay2fk5kj2y7z5zchiwbenamz6xfa5qrg44uv63aqv4.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io">a direct IPFS-TO-HTTP link</a>.
  
  If you actually want to play about with this, you will need an Ethereum, Matic, Fantom or Binance Smart Chain wallet (address & private key) with testnet funds in it.
